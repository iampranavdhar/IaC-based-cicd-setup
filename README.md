## Automated Iaas and Build Process

This project is for practicing terraform, aws, gcp and Jenkins.

With this repo you can spin up Jenkins with single command in GCP and then you can use Jenkins to spin up VM's in GCP to run your application.

### Things to note:

Pre Steps:

1. Setup jenkins by running the terraform commands for jenkins-iaas folder

1. Install all the necessary plugins - terraform, GCP Secret Manager, AWS Secret Manager (if required) and Github Integration [For webhooks management]

1. Setup the credentials to talk to the GCP

   Manage Jenkins > Crendentials > New Credential as secret files

   1. GCP credentials
   2. Pub key

1. The environment variable needs to be mentioned in the Jenkins file and that should be exactly similar to what is mentioned in the terraform official documentation by the provider https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/getting_started#adding-credentials

1. Add webhook url to the webhooks in the settings of the repo.

   ```bash
   http://<instance-ip>:<port-of-jenkins>/github-webhook/
   ```

   This will send a event to the jenkins when ever there is a push or any event [if you select that option]

General:

1. As we are using ingress cidr blocks as the respective IP it will change on connecting to the different network which will results in failure of ssh connection

2. Owner and Team tags needs to be passed inorder to create an EC2 instance because of permission issues

3. See if the google account is having some restrictions, for example that account might have restrictions when we consider the source ranges for the ssh connections, so even if you create resource in gcp and it gets auto deleted based on the restrictions for that specific gcp account, which casuses error for reapplying as terraform will not be able to get that specific resources using get request and the request fails

4. For enabling trace logs

   In your Linux/macOS terminal, run the following commands:

   Set the TF_LOG environment variable:

   ```bash
   export TF_LOG="TRACE"
   ```

   Run the Terraform operation that you wish to debug, e.g., init, plan, apply, or import. Make sure you capture stdout and stderr with 2>&1, and disable ANSI color escape sequences with -no-color:

   ```bash
   terraform plan -no-color 2>&1 | tee output.log
   ```

   Once you are done debugging, remove the variable by running:

   ```bash
   unset TF_LOG
   ```

5. If you face issues while initializing the terraform in `core/iaas`. Make sure you have already run these commands.

   ```bash
   gcloud init
   ```

   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```

   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

   Or you can explictly mention credentials path in backend.tf like below to get rid of the error:

   ```bash
   â”‚ Error: storage.NewClient() failed: dialing: google: could not find default credentials. See https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc for more information
   ```

   ```bash
   terraform {
       backend "gcs" {
           bucket  = "tf-prac-proj-state-bucket"
           prefix  = "terraform/state"
           credentials = "<path of credentials file>"
       }
   }
   ```

### Things to be deleted manually after the terraform destroy:

1. S3 bucket and GCS bucket used for remote backend
